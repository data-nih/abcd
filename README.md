The [Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study](https://abcdstudy.org/) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded leading researchers in the fields of adolescent development and neuroscience to conduct this ambitious project. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of a Coordinating Center, a Data Analysis, Informatics & Resource Center, and 21 research sites across the country, which have invited 11,880 children ages 9-10 to join the study. Researchers will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.

# Methods

> A multishell diffusion scheme was used, and the b-values were 500 ,1000 ,2000, and 3000 s/mm². The number of diffusion sampling directions were 6, 15, 15, and 60, respectively. The in-plane resolution was 1.7 mm. The slice thickness was 1.7 mm. The diffusion MRI data were rotated to align with the AC-PC line at an isotropic resolution of 1.7 (mm). The restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (Yeh et al., MRM, 77:603–612 (2017)). The diffusion data were reconstructed using generalized q-sampling imaging (Yeh et al., IEEE TMI, ;29(9):1626-35, 2010) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25. The tensor metrics were calculated using DWI with b-value lower than 1750 s/mm². This analysis used Bridges-2 at Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center through allocation CIS200026 from the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS) program (Boerner TJ, Deems S, Furlani TR, Knuth SL, Towns J. Access: Advancing innovation: Nsf’s advanced cyberinfrastructure coordination ecosystem: Services & support. InPractice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing 2023 Jul 23 pp. 173-176).
